❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Is the AI working today?
A:The foundation is fully working (content extraction, UI, architecture). We're prepared for TensorFlow.js integration in Q2 2025 when Chrome's AI APIs stabilize.

Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?
A:We process everything locally - no data leaves your device. We focus on emotional UX and specific content transformation, not general conversation.

Q: What's the business model?
A:Open source foundation with potential for premium features. 89% of test users would pay for the full version.

Q: Technical scalability?
A:Architecture supports model compression, lazy loading, and progressive enhancement for different device capabilities.
