🦎 The Chalamandra Philosophy
Like the salamander transforms and adapts, our technology:
Transforms - Dense information becomes clear insights
Adapts - Learns your preferences and needs
Protects - Your data never leaves your device
Technical Architecture
Current Foundation: Web Content → Text Extraction → User Interface → Local Storage
Future Integration (Q2 2025): Web Content → Local AI Processing → Intelligent Summary → Export Options
Privacy by Design:
All processing happens locally (when AI is integrated)
No data transmission to external servers
Complete user control and transparency
